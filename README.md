Please check out our preprocessing code here or our hardware equipment lists and designs for the gantry or the hammer striking mechanisms in the [hardware](hardware) directory.

To download our preprocessed data, run the following, starting from within this repository's base directory:

    cd dataset
    bash download.sh
We are currently working on packaging and releasing the remainder of our code as well as our raw dataset. For specific requests or inquiries, please open an issue in this repo.

_The rest of this Readme is added by Karl Hiner._

The paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09944.pdf.
